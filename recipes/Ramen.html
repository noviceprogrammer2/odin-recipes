    <h1>Ramen</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen is a college staple and with good reason. This meal is CHEAP, delicious, and incredibly easy to make. 
        For this recipe, I will be using chicken flavor (the best one). If you want to spice things up, add an egg 
        at the end for a cheap source of protein. Only a pot and a source of water are needed to make this meal.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Chicken Ramen Pack</li>
        <li>2 Cups of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once water is boiling, add Ramen and stir for 2-3 minutes making sure to break up noodles.</li>
        <li>Drain water from pot.</li>
        <li>Add flavor packet and mix. I personally use half of the flavor packet as it tastes just as good
            but cuts sodium and fats in half. 
        </li>
    </ol>
